 <h4>Message from The Team </h4>
<p>We made this website since it was for a school project to show what we can accomplish together in the time that we had,<br>
it also is to demonstrate how our website can realistically help other people.<br>
We are trying to create a website where creative people like us can grow and can show off their work in a much more memorable and fun way.<br>
We believe it can truly benefit you and help you out in the long run.
